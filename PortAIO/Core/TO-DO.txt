Pretty much all done. PortAIO v2 is in a decent, stable state right now apart from the minor utility bugs/crashes.

- Fix FPS Issue
- Fix Crash issue in utilities


http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=burblish4 - Doing some overnight testing

To-do for ARAMDetFull:
- Add the rest of the champion plugin files (**just basic casting logic** nothing like Shy Riven Combo or anything)
- Add custom builds for ALL champions based on LoLFlavor.com
- Add ingame chat messages (example: saying "rip" after double kill, saying "ez" after penta etc...)
- Track team/enemy kills & auto surrender logic
